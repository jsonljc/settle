# Settle v1.4 Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Product identity is preserved: Settle is a post-moment recovery tool (relief + repair + prevention), not a tracker, dashboard, course, or engagement app.
- [ ] Every screen has one clear primary action; secondary actions are visually quieter and do not compete.
- [ ] Any flow delivers practical value in 15 seconds or less (5 seconds for direct crisis entries like Sleep Tonight).
- [ ] Copy stays calm and scannable: no dense paragraphs, content blocks are short, and emotional tone is warm/non-judgmental.
- [ ] No forms outside onboarding O2 (child basics); interactions elsewhere are taps, chips, toggles, and selections.
- [ ] Every flow has a clear finish path (Close moment or equivalent); no dead-end states.
- [ ] Reset remains minimal and bounded: max 3 `Another` swaps/session, soft friction only at 4+ resets in 2 hours, no added bloat.
- [ ] Sleep follows locked structure: Tonight is the hero lane (no Tonight/Rhythm toggle), each scenario is a short micro-flow, Rhythm is passive setup/support.
- [ ] Tantrum follows locked structure: `Just happened` routes to Reset, debrief appears at most once/day on qualifying repeat events, prevention surfaces max 3 cards.
- [ ] Moment stays a small emergency brake: 10-second haptic regulation, two script choices (Boundary/Connection), tap-to-close behavior.
- [ ] Playbook is a sanctuary for saved repair/prevention cards and supportive resurfacing; no charts, streaks, counters, or scores.
- [ ] v1 architecture remains local-first: native share sheet for co-parent sharing, no server/sync/accounts, graceful fallback to universal content if storage fails.
- [ ] UI is token- and calm-system compliant: spacing/type tokens and approved components are used, one primary CTA per viewport section, accent only for primary action, rose/red only for urgent safety, SOS/Regulate use `T.pal.focusBackground`, and accessibility baseline (44x44 tap targets, large text, reduced motion) is met.
