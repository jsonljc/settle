# Settle v1.4 Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Preserve product identity: Settle remains a post-moment recovery tool (relief + repair + prevention), not a tracker, dashboard, course, or engagement system.
- [ ] Maintain locked navigation/entry decisions: tab model and flow entry behavior match `docs/DECISIONS.md` and `docs/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE_v1_3.md` (including Moment as shortcut, not a full tab lane).
- [ ] Enforce one-primary-action hierarchy per screen/section; secondary actions are visibly lower emphasis.
- [ ] Deliver usable value in 15 seconds or less from any flow entry (and within ~5 seconds for direct crisis entries).
- [ ] Keep copy calm and low-load: short blocks (about 1-2 short sentences), no dense paragraphs, no judgmental/guilt-inducing tone.
- [ ] Keep interaction lightweight: no forms outside onboarding O2; use taps/chips/toggles/time pickers instead of keyboard input.
- [ ] Ensure every flow has a clear end state (Close moment or direct equivalent); no dead ends.
- [ ] Keep Reset "sacred": no bloat, max 3 `Another` swaps/session, and soft friction only at 4+ resets in 2 hours.
- [ ] Keep Sleep tactical: Tonight is the hero lane, scenarios stay micro-flow length, Rhythm is supportive/passive (not a dashboard lane).
- [ ] Keep Tantrum post-event: `Just happened` routes into Reset, debrief appears only under locked trigger conditions, and prevention is capped to 3 cards/visit.
- [ ] Keep Moment minimal: 10-second haptic regulation, two script choices, tap-to-close, optional later handoff to Reset.
- [ ] Keep Playbook as sanctuary: saved repair/prevention cards plus supportive resurfacing; no charts, counters, streaks, scores, or punitive framing.
- [ ] Respect sharing/notification boundaries: native share sheet co-parent sharing in v1, no forced social loops, and no pressure notifications (no streaks/"we miss you").
- [ ] Enforce design-system calm baseline: token spacing/type, approved primitives, accent reserved for primary CTA, rose/red only for urgent safety, SOS/Regulate on `T.pal.focusBackground`, and accessibility minimums (44x44 tap targets, large text support, reduced motion).
